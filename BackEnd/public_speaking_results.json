    "response_analysis": "The provided video is a still image, a close-up of a young man's face.  There's no audio or movement to analyze.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide feedback on tone, emotions, clarity, vocal engagement, voice modulation, pacing, body language, posture, facial expressions, eye contact, hand gestures, or their effectiveness in conveying confidence and connecting with an audience.  To give meaningful feedback, a video with audio and movement is required.",
